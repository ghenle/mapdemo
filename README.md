# Map Demo

The goal was a simpler embedded map application w/out the overhead and unused capabilities of complex mapping APIs such as Google Maps and Mapbox

Geo labels used a PHP conversion (https://github.com/ghenle/php-polylabel) of Mapbox's https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel to find center of mass placement.

US SVG file was created from an Albers projection shapefile. source: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-data.html
