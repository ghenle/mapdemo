# Polylabel Map Demo

The goal was a simpler embedded map application w/out the overhead and unused capabilities of complex mapping APIs such as Google Maps and Mapbox

Geo labels used a PHP conversion (https://github.com/ghenle/php-polylabel) of Mapbox's https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel to find center of mass placement.
