# Polylabel Map Demo

Geo labels used a PHP conversion (https://github.com/ghenle/php-polylabel) of Mapbox's https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel to find center of mass placement.

US SVG file was created from the US Census Bureau TIGER/Line Albers projection US shapefile. Source: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-data.html

The map demos the State name label placement at the pole of inaccessibility, sometimes also referred to as the visual center of mass, using PHP Polylabel during the conversion of a geographic shapefile into a SVG file.
